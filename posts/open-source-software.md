Hello world, and welcome to my blog! Today, I'll be writing about open source software, and my opinions on it.

As you may know, I am a strong believer of OSS (Open source software). I believe it has made massive changes in how we build software and write code. The majority of some of the most notable companies in the world would not be able to function without OSS. For example, MacOS is a distribution of Linux, which is an example of open source software.
