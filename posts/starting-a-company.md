Hello, world, and welcome to my second blog post! As the title suggests, I'm going to be writing about my experiences launching, building and growing a SaaS startup. Personally, I'd always dreamed about one day starting a company, and one day I had an idea for one. I had had many ideas for startups before. A few examples of these are; a kit to help you build your own computer, a note taking company and a fancy to-do list. However, one day I thought of a website, that helps you build yourself a portfolio. I was in love with the idea, so I decided to build it.

First off, I needed some inspirations for everything from the website, to the initial product and how I'd launch the product. My main inspirations included: 
- [Amie](https://amie.so) 
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Notion](https://notion.so)

Once I'd collected all of my initial inspirations, and figured out my concepts, I needed to find the perfect audience (More commonly known as my target audience). I did some research, and decided that the best people to target were people working in tech.
